### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a final-year Software Engineering undergraduate at Cardiff Metropolitan University. I love building clean, reliable backend systems and bridging academic knowledge with real-world applications.

My current focus is on enterprise architecture, AI integration, analytics, and cross-functional systems — gained through collaborative projects and continuous learning.

### 🚧 What I’m Working On

- ⚙️ **Enterprise Engineering**  
  Designing systems using **event-driven architecture**, **JavaFX**, **REST APIs**, **secure multi-role access**, and **modular design**.  
  Applied both **Layered Architecture** and **Event-Driven Microservices** to build scalable, real-world backend systems.

- 🧪 **Learning in Action**  
  Building full-stack apps using **Spring Boot**, **Angular**, **React**, and **CI/CD** pipelines with **GitHub Actions**.  
  Exploring **Docker**, charting libraries, and frontend-backend integration.
