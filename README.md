### 🧭 Who Am I?

I'm a final-year Software Engineering student at Cardiff Metropolitan University, UK — working at the intersection of education, enterprise software, and scalable backend systems. I enjoy turning complex problems into clean, maintainable code, and building projects that mirror real industry standards.

Alongside my degree, I'm involved in collaborative projects that push me beyond the classroom: from standalone apps to backend systems built with event-driven architecture and advanced database design.

### 🚧 What I’m Building Right Now

- 🎓 **Capstone Project: IntelliCare**  
  A university-level enterprise application using **Advanced Java**, integrated **AI features**, and analytics built in **R**.  
  It supports patient tracking, prescription logs, and predictive analysis for smart healthcare insights.

- 🏗️ **Enterprise Architecture Projects**  
  Real-world engineering contributions involving **event-driven logic**, **microservices**, **RESTful APIs**, and **modular systems**.  
  Currently working on multi-user apps with **JavaFX**, secure role-based login, and scalable data storage.

- 🛠️ **Learning by Doing**  
  Constantly building mini-projects to master topics like **Spring Boot**, **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**, **containerization**, and modern UI flows.  
  I'm also experimenting with **React**, **charting libraries**, and **API integration** to create end-to-end prototypes.
